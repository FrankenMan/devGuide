OTPless is not currently possible with PANDA / SNAKE consoles because no developer FIRM has the necessary properties.
{: .notice--info}

For now, a DS flashcart is _required_!
{: .notice--info}

Before starting, you may want to check your SD card for errors using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac))!
{: .notice--warning}

#### Overview of steps

- Install the 0_23_5 CIAs for your region / device
- Downgrade the MSET application to 0_17_6 on 0_23_5
- Use a DS flashcart to install an MSET rop for launching Decrypt9
- Use a ctrtransfer to get to 0_15_20
- Use a modified SafeA9LHInstaller to install arm9loaderhax and dump the OTP

Continue to [0_23_5 Install](0_23_5-install)
