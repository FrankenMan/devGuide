Before starting, you may want to check your SD card for errors using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3X (Mac)](f3x-(mac))!

#### Overview of steps

- Install the 9.2.0 CIAs for your region / device
- Downgrade the MSET application to 4.0.0 on 9.2.0
- Use a DS flashcart to install an MSET rop for launching Decrypt9
- Use a ctrtransfer to get to 2.1.0
- Use a modified SafeA9LHInstaller to install arm9loaderhax and dump the OTP

Continue to [9.2.0 Install](9.2.0-install)
